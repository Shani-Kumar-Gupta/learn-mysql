1. COUNT - count the number of records in the table.


2. GROUP BY - It's summarizes or aggregates identical data into single rows.
  Count how many books each author has written? (We can't achieve using DISTINCT and COUNT)
 select author_lname, author_fname, count(*) from books GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;
 select author_lname, author_fname, count(*) AS book_count from books GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname ORDER BY book_count;
 select released_year, count(*) from books GROUP BY released_year;

  SELECT author_fname, author_lname, COUNT(*) 
  FROM books 
  GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;
 
  SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author,  COUNT(*)
  FROM books
  GROUP BY author;

  Eg. Find the year each author released their first book?
  SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author, MIN(released_year) FROM books GROUP BY author;

  Eg. Find the longest page count for each author?
  SELECT author_fname, author_lname, MAX(pages) FROM books GROUP BY author_fname, author_lname;

  Eg. Sum all pages each author has written?
  SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author, SUM(pages) FROM books GROUP BY author;

3. MIN and MAX -
select title, MAX(pages) AS page_count from books GROUP BY title ORDER BY page_count DESC LIMIT 1;
