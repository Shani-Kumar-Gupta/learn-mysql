1. DISTINCT - Used to eliminate the duplicate results.
   SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) from books;
   SELECT DISTINCT author_fname, author_lname FROM books;

2. ORDER BY - ASC | DESC - Sorting our results
SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) as author from books ORDER BY author;

3. LIMIT - Controls the number of results to be returned

4. LIKE - Better Searching - Used to fuzzy search not for exact match 
Eg. Select author_fname from books WHERE author_fname LIKE '%da%'; - Here, % - WILDCARD (Zero or more than one character)
